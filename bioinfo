1/ You’re merging gene data across tools. Suddenly nothing matches.
 ENSEMBL, ENTREZ, TP53, P53...
 Why so many gene IDs?

2/
 Gene ID chaos is real.
 One gene, three names: ENSEMBL ID, ENTREZ ID, gene symbol.
 Different formats, same biology—but not always.

3/
 ENTREZ ID is a stable integer from NCBI.
 Example: TP53 = 7157

4/
 ENSEMBL ID is versioned and specific.
 TP53 = ENSG00000141510
 Used in Ensembl, Gencode, and many RNA-seq pipelines.

5/
 Then you have gene symbols.
 TP53 is the official name.
 But some still write P53 (not wrong—just outdated).

6/
 Here’s the problem:
 One ENSEMBL ID can link to multiple symbols.
 One symbol can map to many ENSEMBL IDs.
 Now you’re stuck.

7/
 Why so messy?
 Gene annotations evolve.
 A new transcript is discovered.
 A gene gets renamed.
 Science moves, but your data might not.

8/
 How do you fix this?
 Use biomaRt in R to map IDs reliably.
 It pulls live data from Ensembl. Here’s a working example:

9/
library(biomaRt) 
mart <- useMart("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl") 
getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "entrezgene_id", "external_gene_name"), 
 filters = "ensembl_gene_id", 
 values = "ENSG00000141510", 
 mart = mart) 


Returns TP53, 7157, and ENSEMBL ID.

10/
 Prefer the browser?
 Use Ensembl BioMart: https://lnkd.in/ePht4G5G
 Or NCBI Gene: https://lnkd.in/exX3KrrW
 Paste your ID—get all the links.

11/
 Still getting P53 instead of TP53?
 That’s a gene symbol alias.
 Fix it with the HGNChelper package in R.

12/
install.packages("HGNChelper") 
library(HGNChelper) 
checkGeneSymbols("P53") 

It corrects aliases and returns TP53.


13/
 Now let’s go across species.
 You’re comparing human and mouse data.
 Use babelgene to find orthologs.

14/
install.packages("babelgene") 
library(babelgene) 
orthologs("BRCA1", species = "mouse") 

Returns mouse Brca1 with corresponding IDs.

15/
 You can also convert ENTREZ IDs with org.Hs.eg.db:
library(org.Hs.eg.db) 
mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = "1017", column = "SYMBOL", 
 keytype = "ENTREZID", multiVals = "first") 

Maps 1017 to CDK2.

16/
 Gene names are messy:
Synonyms (P53 = TP53)

Aliases

Orthologs

Outdated IDs
They break pipelines if unchecked.

17/
 Key takeaways:
Gene IDs are not interchangeable

Use HGNChelper to fix aliases

Use biomaRt and babelgene to convert reliably

Always double-check across species
